== Jenkins

We use http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder[Jenkins Job Builder]
to configure CI jobs on a local Jenkins instance.


=== Setup

First, install Jenkins Job Builder:

[%header, cols="1,3,3"]
|===
| OS | Package | Source ("port")
| FreeBSD | `py27-jenkins-job-builder` | `devel/py-jenkins-job-builder`
|===

Next, copy link:config.ini.sample[] to `config.ini` and edit it to include your
Jenkins server's URI as well as your credentials on that server
(visit `${SERVER_URI}/me/configure` and click "Show API token").


=== Usage

To check the configuration, run `make test` (or simply `make`).
This will report any errors in the configuration.

To update jobs on the Jenkins server, run `make update`.
This will create new jobs or modify existing jobs as appropriate.
It will _not_ delete jobs, as the absence of a job in the configuration file
may simply mean that the job is managed by a different configuration (or is
managed manually).
